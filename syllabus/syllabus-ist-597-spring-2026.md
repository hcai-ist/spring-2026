## Description
This course will explore design principles and implementation strategies for Human Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI). It will focus on understanding requirements and guidelines for AI applications to support human values, ethics, and positive user experiences. The course will also explore the challenges and opportunities of using generative AI in different application contexts. By the end of the course, students should be able to conduct need assessments for designing AI applications, prototyping human-AI interactions, and human-centered assessment of AI applications. The course will follow a learning-by-doing approach with hands-on class activities and interactions.

## Course Requirements

### Class Activity (30%)
We will conduct interactive discussion sessions[^acknowledgement] based on the theme and assigned readings on a given week. Each student will lead two discussion sessions during the semester. **Sign up for two classes as a discussion leader in [this spreadsheet](#)**.

#### Readers
Readers will create one slide for each of the assigned readings:

* Add your response to the corresponding slide deck in [Google Drive]()
	* There is [one folder for each class]().
	* Each of these folders have one slide deck for each assigned readings
		* For example, [Week 3](#week-3-0130-when-is-ai-useful) has two decks: [one for Vaccaro et al.]() and [another for Lee et al.]()
	* Create one slide per article
* Respond in 1-2 sentences to the following categories
	* Contributions — What are the main contributions here?
	* Insights — What did you learn or find compelling?
	* Surprised — What challenged your expectations?
	* Test of Time — Will this still be true or relevant in 5 years?
	* Connections — How does this link to other topics, readings, or the world?	
* Add your slide **24 hours before the class**, so that discussion leaders can include them in their activity

#### Discussion Leaders
The discussion leaders will synthesize responses from readers and their own thoughts from all assigned readings into an exploratory exercise for the class:


* The exercise should **not** just be a lecture
	* Though, you should summarize responses from the readers (< 5 minutes)
* Each exercise should take 30–40 minutes and then another 30–40 minutes of reflection and discussion
* For designing interactive exercise, please use the following resources:
	* [Stanford TeachingWriting Activities](https://teachingwriting.stanford.edu/classroom-activities/all-activities). E.g.,
		* [Mining reading](https://teachingwriting.stanford.edu/mining-reading)
		* [Doubter and Believer](https://teachingwriting.stanford.edu/channeling-doubter-and-believer)
	* [University of Waterloo In-Class Activities List](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/class-activities-and-assessment-flipped-classroom). E.g.,
		* [Three-step interview](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/class-activities-and-assessment-flipped-classroom#:~:text=Three%2Dstep%20interview)
		* [Fishbowl discussion](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/class-activities-and-assessment-flipped-classroom#:~:text=Fishbowl%20discussion)
		* [Think-Pair-Share](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/catalogs/tip-sheets/class-activities-and-assessment-flipped-classroom#:~:text=Think%2DPair%2DShare)



### Assignment (20%)

There will be two assignments throughout the course. See [Canvas](#course-info) for deadlines.

### Final Project (50%)

Each student will complete a final project. The main goal here is to learn to design, develop, and evaluate a HCAI system from scratch. As such, the project provides an excellent opportunity to put skills developed in the course into practice. In an ideal case, the project will become a part of a student’s research portfolio and resume for future internship and job opportunities. Your project paper could also be a first draft for a peer-review submission. We also highly encourage you to use this opportunity to participate in external events like [Nittany AI Challenge](https://nittanyai.psu.edu/alliance-programs/nittany-ai-challenge/) and [IdeaMakers Challenge](https://pennstateideamakers.weebly.com/).

There is considerable flexibility in terms of choosing a topic for the
final project. You should consult with the staff as early as
possible regarding a project topic.

#### Project Proposal (5%)

The proposal should provide a clear outline of your plan and timeline
for the project. It should be around 2 pages and include:

- *What and why:* You should provide a concise description of the
  problem you are trying to address and identify why this is an
  important problem to address. Who will be your intended users?

- *How:* The proposal should describe how you are going to approach the problem. You should try to justify why this approach makes sense, perhaps indicating some references you will be using to develop the project. You should also identify your plan for implementation. For example,

	- What are the interactions and use cases you will aim to implement?
	- What types of data will you use?

- *Evaluation:* What are the criteria and metrics for success for your
  project? How are you planning to evaluate your system?

- *Timeline:* You should also provide a detailed plan and timeline for
  your project. What are the major milestones in terms of
  implementation? When and how will you complete these milestones?
  



#### Proposal Presentation (10%)

Each student will present their project proposal to the class. You should plan a 5-minute presentation of your proposal with the goal of presenting enough concrete detail to get feedback and suggestions on issues that are important to you as you are carrying out the project. During the presentation, you should clearly convey what the project is, what you are trying to achieve, the current state of the art and your planned contribution (what is new in your project).

#### Progress Report (5%)
The goal of the progress report is to get another set of reviews and feedback from the instructor. It will also help to identify whether you need to revisit the scope of the project and update the timeline accordingly. The report should include:

- A concise description of the research contributions and goals
- An introductory literature review
- Description of data plan
	- what types of data will be used for your project
	- How are you going to get relevant datasets
- Description of technology development and computational method implementation done so far
- An updated project timeline (what has been done and what needs to be done)


#### Final Presentation (10%)

At the end of the class, students will do a poster presentation of their projects. Each presentation will be 5 minutes, supported by a single-page research poster. This is good practice for conference poster sessions, which are a common event at research conferences that often attract more junior-level researchers.

#### Final Code + Paper Submission (20%)
Your final submission should contain: code and a paper.

* **Code**: Submit the code and a README file with instructions regarding how to run the code.
* **Paper**: Please use the [CHI Late-Breaking Work (LBW) format](https://chi2025.acm.org/for-authors/late-breaking-work/) for the final paper:
	* Template: ACM Master Article Submission Templates (single column)
	* Length: Up to 8 pages long (excluding references)

Penn State provides excellent coaching support for writing skills, including one-to-one consultations from the [Graduate Writing Center (GWC)](https://gwc.psu.edu/). 


### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy

Computers are REQUIRED for in-class activities, but this course is NOT held in a computer lab. Students are required to BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) for in-class activities. Penn State is committed to supporting any student who needs a device for use during the semester. Please utilize these resources if you have a need at any time:

* [Penn State’s IT Help Portal](https://pennstate.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=af267702dbef04d007036bba4b9619cd)
    
* [Penn State Library – Wagner Building Annex](https://libraries.psu.edu/about/departments/media-and-technology-support-services-wagner-annex) Students studying at University Park campus can sign out a Mac laptop, PC laptop, iPad with attached keyboard, etc., for all or part of any semester. (Web Access login required to make reservations through [the Patron Portal](https://wco.psu.edu/sso/patron/#!/))

### Programming
A key goal of the class is to create and evaluate human-centered AI systems. This will require some programming experience in python. If you need a refresher on python, you might find [IST peer-tutoring](https://learning.ist.psu.edu/tutoring/university-park) useful.

### Attendance
Class attendance is essential and required given our focus on hands-on activities (as well as group discussion). Excused absences should be approved by the instructor before the class to be missed. Please consult with me if you expect to miss more than one class meeting during the semester.

### Late submissions
Late submissions will result in points deduction as follows:

* 25% up to 12 hours
* 50% up to 24 hours
* 100% after 48 hours

### Grade Disputes
If you have a question about your graded assignment or exam/quizzes, you have 1 week from the date that the assignment grade/comment was given to you to email any issues to the professor. Point changes will not be made at the end of the semester.

### Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

### Disability Accommodation

Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s
educational programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students
with disabilities. Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides
contact information for [every Penn State campus](https://equity.psu.edu/offices/student-disability-resources/campus-offices). For further
information, please visit the [Student Disability Resources website](http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/).

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you
must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus
where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview,
and provide documentation ([see documentation guidelines](http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines)). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

### Counseling and psychological services

Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have
psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress,
social development, or emotional well-being. The university offers a
variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times,
including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention,
consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These
services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a
philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds,
and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and
sexual orientation.

### Educational Equity/Report Bias

Consistent with University Policy AD29, students who believe they have
experienced or observed a hate crime, an act of intolerance,
discrimination, or harassment that occurs at Penn State are urged to
report these incidents as outlined on the [University’s Report Bias webpage](http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/).

### Preferred Name & Preferred Gender Pronouns

Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal
name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate
name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference so that I
may make appropriate changes to my records.

### Student Class Recording

According to University Policy AD 40, students must get express
permission from their instructor to record class sessions. Screenshots
showing instructors and students are considered recordings. Even if
permission is granted, student-initiated recordings must be used only
for educational purposes for the students enrolled in the initiating
student’s class. Recordings may be used only during the period in which
the student is enrolled in the class. Authorized student-initiated
recordings may not be posted or shared in any fashion outside of the
class, including online or through other media, without the express
written consent of the course instructor or appropriate University
administrator. Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of
class recordings may be held in violation of the University’s Code of
Conduct, and/or liable under Federal and State laws.

### Copyright Statement

All course materials students receive or to which students have online
access are protected by copyright laws. For courses in which they have
previously been or are currently enrolled, students may use course
materials and make copies for their own use as needed, but unauthorized
distribution and/or uploading of materials without the instructor’s
express permission is strictly prohibited. Policy AD 40 (Recording of
Classroom Activities and Note Taking Services) addresses this issue.
Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted
materials may be held in violation of the University’s Code of Conduct,
and/or liable under Federal and State laws.


### Emergency Notifications

PSUAlert is available at <https://psualert.psu.edu/>. PSUAlert is Penn
State’s emergency notification system for students, faculty and staff.
The system will be used to alert members of Penn State’s campus
communities of emergencies, campus closings and other urgent
information. Using this portal, students, faculty and staff can choose
to receive PSUAlert messages by text message, voice message and e‑mail.
We recommend that students enroll in this system.



### Communication Expectation

#### Questions and Other Communications with Instructor

Please use Canvas Inbox for communication. Instructors aims to respond in 1-2 day to student emails during normal business hours.

#### Group work

Part of this course will include group work (e.g., discussion during class activities). You are expected to collaborate and communicate with your group members in a professional manner. Group grades will only be given to participating group members.  When providing feedback to a classmate, you are expected to offer positive, constructive criticism.


#### Logging into Canvas 
Students are expected to log in to Canvas daily, to check for course
updates, announcements, emails, and discussions.

#### Emailing through Canvas

Students are expected to use Canvas for all course email communication
with the professor and students are expected to check their email and
notifications at least daily.

### Use of Generative AI tools

You are **allowed** to use generative AI tools for the assignments and the final project. Why? As you apply for jobs, you will need to know how to leverage AI tools to meet the expectations for both quality and timeliness. When using generative AI tools, you must show understanding of prompt
engineering, engage in content generation checking, and appropriately
reference the tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Midjourney) from which the content
(e.g., text, image, ideas) was generated.

- For suggestions on how to properly cite and reference generative AI
  tools, please see the following webpages:
    + <https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt>
